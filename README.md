# npm-init
_A basic course on Node.js_

This is the code written during the course _npm-init_, by [Aldo D'Aquino](https://ald.ooo).  
I prepared this folder to share the code I write during the lessons with (only) the people that have followed the codelab.  
Please don't share it with someone else.

**This folder alone is not a Node.js course.**  
If you would like to learn Node.js by yourself I can suggest you the W3Schools courses of [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) and [Node.js](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/).  
This courses are provided for free by the WWW Consortium (aka W3C), that is the web consortium.
